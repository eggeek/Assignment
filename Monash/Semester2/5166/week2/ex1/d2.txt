The unit will provide students with an introduction and
broad overview of the application of IT to the
management of information in organisations, and the role
of the IT professional in developing and implementing ITbased
solutions to information problems. The discussion
of the organisational framework for IT and IT professional
practice will be set within its broader social context.
