# Local Area Networks

## Be aware of the roles of LANs in organizations
- limited area
- circuit owned by the organisation
- can be operated without obtaining a license
- sharing: to reduce cost
    - information sharing: file, database servers, communication
    - resource sharing: hardware, software licenses, internet connection
- example: university lab, home, public WiFi access point

- Dedicated server LAN

        network contains servers and clients,
        each server has one or more specific tasks
        most popular type of business network

- Peer-to-Peer LAN

        no dedicated servers,
        all computers act as oth servers and clients,
        example: your home LAN

- Compare:
                Dedicate    |       P2P
            ---
Cost        |   expensive   |   cheap
Performance |   very high   |   lower
Reliability |   very high   |   lower
Management  |   easier      |   more difficult

## Understand the major components of LANs
- Client, NIC (Network interface card)
- Switch
- Server, NOS (Network Operating System)
    - Server NOS provides network management tools and network services
    - Client NOS provide access to the network services

## Understand traditional and switched Ethernet LANs
- Switch
    - bus toplogy
- Network switch
    - looks like hub, but circuit no longer shared
    - layer 2 device
    - logical star topology
- Switch operations
    - cut through switching:
    transmit as soon as desination address has been read
    > low latency, but may transmit frames that have errors
    - store and forward switching
    > higher latency, but less capacity wasted with errors

## Understand the best practice recommendations for LAN design
## Be familiar with how to improve LAN performance
